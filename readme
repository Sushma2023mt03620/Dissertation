This project presents a comprehensive solution design and proof-of-concept implementation for refactoring a legacy automotive manufacturing platform into a modern cloud-native ecosystem. Given the scope and complexity of a full enterprise-scale implementation (requiring 12-18 months with a dedicated team), this academic project focuses on architectural design, technology evaluation, and prototype development to demonstrate cloud computing competencies and validate design decisions.

1. Academic Rigor:

"This project demonstrates design science research methodology appropriate for MTech-level work"
"Focus on architecture, design patterns, and technical decision-making"
"Comprehensive research into Industry 4.0 and automotive cloud solutions"

2. Technical Depth:

"Working prototypes of critical components validate architectural choices"
"Infrastructure-as-Code and DevOps practices fully implemented in development environment"
"Real Azure services utilized, not just theoretical designs"

3. Practical Validation:

"Performance testing and benchmarking provide empirical evidence"
"Quality metrics demonstrate engineering best practices"
"Challenges documented show real-world problem-solving"

4. Scalability Focus:

"Architecture designed for enterprise-scale, proven in development environment"
"All components architected to scale to production requirements"
"Technology selections based on enterprise-grade requirements"



Focused demonstration of cloud architecture, design patterns, and proof-of-concept implementation of critical components rather than full enterprise-scale deployment.
